# elm-magento--address-book-manager
## Proof of concept for Elm with Magento
The current stack for Magento relies on technologies that require massive efforts to trouble-shoot and maintain. Elm is the opposite of that. This is an attempt to start improving the stack by taking a first step towards Elm.

### Please Help
I'm presenting the Elm argument at MageX in Austin in less than a month and need to get this prototype rolling! If you contribute code or documentation, I will happily give generous kudos during my talk.

Want to help? Pick up an issue from the [Project section](https://github.com/razoyo/elm-magento--address-book-manager/projects/1)
